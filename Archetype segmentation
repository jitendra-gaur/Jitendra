# Archetype Analysis

Archetypal analysis is a method for analyzing and understanding the heterogeneity of consumers (or products) in a market. The technique is well established in the
physical science and mathematics, but was only introduced to the field of marketing research in 1998.

Mass marketing is one extreme: everyone is offered the same product(s), the same advertising and promotion, the same distribution
channels, the same prices. More sophisticated marketers employ market segmentation where consumers are divided into two or more classes with a different
marketing mix for each class. 

Using segmentation research, a marketer can:
• Estimate the size of each segment and its share of category volume
• Select one or more segments to target
• Create a marketing mix tailored to each target segment

Each dot is a consumer. There are three obvious segments here, so those within a certain distance of the mid-point of each segment are assigned to that segment (the
red circles).

# Archetypal Analysis: An Alternative Paradigm
Archetypal analysis is an alternative to traditional segmentation for understanding
consumer heterogeneity.
• Segmentation (at least when based on statistical cluster analysis) makes the
implicit assumption that there are several "average" consumers. They are
found in the dead center, statistically speaking, of each cluster.
• Archetypal analysis assumes instead that there are several "pure" consumers
who are on the "edges" of the data. All others are considered to be mixtures
of these pure types.
