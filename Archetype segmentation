# Archetype Analysis

Archetypal analysis is a method for analyzing and understanding the heterogeneity of consumers (or products) in a market. The technique is well established in the
physical science and mathematics, but was only introduced to the field of marketing research in 1998.

Mass marketing is one extreme: everyone is offered the same product(s), the same advertising and promotion, the same distribution
channels, the same prices. More sophisticated marketers employ market segmentation where consumers are divided into two or more classes with a different
marketing mix for each class. 

Using segmentation research, a marketer can:
• Estimate the size of each segment and its share of category volume
• Select one or more segments to target
• Create a marketing mix tailored to each target segment
