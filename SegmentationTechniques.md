Four different segmentation techniques

# Factor Segmentation

Factor segmentation is based on factor analysis. The first step is to factor-analyze or form groups of attributes that express some sort of common theme. The number of factors is determined using a combination of statistics and knowledge of the category. Once the number of factors has been determined, each respondent receives a score for each of the factors. Respondents are then assigned to the factor that has the highest score.

# K-Means Clustering

This method attempts to identify similar groups of respondents based on selected characteristics. Like most segmentation techniques, k-means clustering requires that the analyst specifies the desired number of clusters or segments. During the procedure the distances of each respondent from the cluster centers are calculated. The procedure repeats until the distance between cluster centers is maximized (or other specified criterion is reached). Respondents are assigned to the cluster with the nearest center.

The procedure provides some statistics that can provide information on the ability of each variable to differentiate the segments. K-means is simple to execute because most statistical software packages include this procedure, and it can be used with a large number of respondents or data records.

TwoStep Cluster Analysis

TwoStep cluster analysis is based on hierarchical clustering (SPSS Inc., 2001; Zhang, et al., 1996; and Chiu et al., 2001). The algorithm identifies groups of cases that exhibit similar response patterns. Typically, cases are assigned to the cluster with the nearest center. The analyst can specify a noise percentage (cases that do not belong to any cluster) however. Segment membership is then determined by the distance of the respondent to the closest nonnoise cluster and to the noise cluster. Respondents who are nearest to the noise cluster are considered outliers.

The algorithm contains two stages: (1) preclustering and (2) hierarchical clustering. The precluster stage groups the respondents into several small clusters. The cluster stage uses the small clusters as input and groups them into larger clusters. Based on well-defined statistics, the procedure can automatically select the optimal number of clusters given the input variables. The algorithm is able to handle both continuous and categorical segmentation variables.

Latent Class Cluster Analysis

Latent class cluster analysis uses probability modeling to maximize the overall fit of the model to the data. The model can identify patterns in multiple dependent variables (such as attitudes and needs) and quantify correlation of dependent variables with related variables (such as buying behaviors). For each survey respondent, the analysis delivers the probability of belonging to each cluster (segment). Respondents are assigned to the cluster to which they have the highest probability of belonging.

This method includes statistics to guide the analyst in selecting the optimal number of clusters, and it can incorporate segmentation variables of mixed metrics. Latent class cluster analysis can include respondents who have missing values for some of the dependent variables, which reduces the rate of misclassification (assigning consumers or businesses to the wrong segment).
